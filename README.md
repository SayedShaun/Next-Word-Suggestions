## Next Word Suggestions

Welcome to my Next Word Suggestions project repository! This project aims to create a next-word prediction system using LSTM neural networks and word embeddings. It involves training the model to understand language context and accurately suggest the next word in a sequence of text. The process includes data preprocessing, building an LSTM architecture with word embeddings, training the model, and evaluating its accuracy to deploy a system that offers contextually relevant word suggestions.

## Overview

This repository contains:

- `app.py`: Implementation of a user-friendly interface for next word suggestions using Streamlit.
- `Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for comprehensive data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `datasets/`: Curated datasets utilized for training and testing purposes.
- `images/`: Visual resources and diagrams pertaining to the project.
- `Saved Model/`: Directory housing trained models and their associated tokenizers.
- `requirements.txt`: List of essential Python packages required for seamless setup.
- `.gitignore`: Specification of files and directories excluded from version control.
- `.gitattributes`: Configuration file for Git attributes.
- `LICENSE`: Information regarding the project's licensing.
